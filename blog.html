		  <h2>18 February 2021 – Proof of Concept Demonstration</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>Beginning the last week of January 2021, our colleagues at UMaine arranged for four prototype (Phase I) WOWLs to be deployed by commercial lobstermen operating out of Friendship, ME. The first figure shows photographs of two of these units and where the fishing gear was deployed. The WOWLs logged bottom temperature and depth data every minute for over 12 days. The second figure shows bottom temperature and depth time series for each of these nodes. A few features are noted. First, the shallower site (sensor 9) is often cooler than the deeper sites (as is expected for the time of year). Second, the bottom temperature resolution is sufficient to capture interesting features, such as pockets of warmer (by around 0.5 C) water flowing by sensors 3, 5, and 6 throughout the deployment. Finally, the depth sensor resolution is more than sufficient to capture tidal variation. Indeed, closer inspection of the data reveal sensor-to-sensor tide height variation on the order of only 4 cm.</p>

		  <h2>20 December 2020 – Testing at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center Dock</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>Our colleagues at DMC deployed one of our first WOWL units off their dock on the Damariscotta River over the weekend.  The WOWL was co-deployed with a scientific grade measurement sonde (YSI EXO series) and an Onset HOBO UA-002-08 data logger.  For this test, we’re considering the YSI sonde to represent the “ground truth” temperature during the deployment.  The HOBO logger retails around our target price point for the WOWL and has a specified temperature accuracy of +/- 0.5 C.</p>

			<p>The plots below show temperature and depth data from this deployment. Unfortunately, the YSI sonde ran out of batteries around 22 hours after the start of the experiment (we had set the sample rate a little high and it chewed through its batteries!).  Most of the WOWL prototype’s six temperature sensors performed very nicely with respect to the ground truth. The numbers in parenthesis are the RMS error relative to ground truth.  We’ll use this data to help inform our sensor down-select decision for the next generation device.  As of right now, the dedicated temperature IC appears to be the front runner – representing a good balance between cost and performance.</p>
			<p>Once fully deployed, the WOWL and the ground truth depth readings tracked very nicely, well within our target 0.1 meters of seawater (msw) objective.  </p>

		  <h2>21 November 2020 - It’s Alive!</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>Our first WOWL lives!  Yesterday we placed our first fully-encapsulated WOWL prototype in a “milkcan” pressure vessel and let it sit at various pressures (30, 35, 20, and, briefly, 60 psi (gage)).  We then downloaded the data via our (still in development) application and took a quick look at it in Matlab (plots below).  The pressure data tracks our expectations nicely – if you look closely you can see the period cycling of our shop air supply. We see the expected increases and decreases in temperature with the compression and decompression of the vessel.  All and all this was a pleasant demonstration of functionality!</p>

		  <h2>10 November 2020 – Our First Urethane Castings!</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>We made our first successful mold of the WOWL housings today.  We’re using a semi-rigid, semi-transparent urethan rubber as it represents a good balance between durability, flexibility, and ease of use.  The WOWL housing is designed to be inserted into the frame channels on commercial lobster traps – the “arrow” shape allows for relatively easy insertion while locking the WOWL in place. </p>

		  <h2>1 October 2020 – Our Circuits Have Arrived</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>Exciting Day!  The assembled printed circuit boards for the first-generation WOWL prototypes arrived today.  I knew they were going to be small, but I was still surprised at exactly how small when I first held one.  Future units will be even smaller – the first generation WOWL has six (well, seven if you count the poor-quality sensor in the microcontroller) independent measurements of temperature.  One of our goals with these first-generation units is to select the sensor we like best. We quickly connected the battery on one unit and placed it on a wireless charging station – and it appears to be working!</p>

		  <h2>10 September 2020 – A Visit to Interstate Lobster</h2>
		  <h4>
		    <p>Our colleagues at DMC arranged a visit with a group of commercial lobster harvesters from Interstate Lobster.  The crew at Interstate have been very supportive of DMC’s scientific studies. Eric and I chatted with the harvesters for a little over an hour. They very patiently explained their day-to-day operations to us pencil heads. As a whole, they are well aware of how bottom temperature drives the lobster catch and were very supportive of our (and NOAA’s) goals with the WOWL.  We gained very valuable insights into potential WOWL use cases and working environments as well as a number of good suggestions for where a WOWL could be installed on a trap with minimal interference with day-to-day operations. They even sent us home with an old lobster trap (that just barely fit in Eric’s Jetta) to help with our design work!</p>
